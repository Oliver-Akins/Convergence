	<h2>Preface</h2>
	<p>
		All of the data models follow similar syntax for types and information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A <code>?</code> after the "Type" of a property means that it is a
			nullable field. Though it will always be returned (if it is set to
			be returned even if it were not nullable).
		</li>
		<li>
			A <code>?</code> after the "Property" name means that the property
			may not always be returned, but when it is, it will always the type
			indicated.
		</li>
		<li>
			Each property can have a number of superscript note indicators after
			it, these indicators correspond to a note(s) at the bottom of the
			table.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<sup>[0]</sup>: This is a read-only property, attempting to modify it will
	result in an HTTP 400 error.

	<sup>[2]</sup>: This is not expanded to contain the full object.

	<sup>[3]</sup>: This is only returned from the <code>/users/{user}</code>
	endpoints when the user that is being requested is also the authenticated
	user.
