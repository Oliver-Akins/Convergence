	<h2>Preface</h2>
	<p>
		All of the data models follow similar syntax for types and information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A <code>?</code> after the "Type" of a property means that it is a
			nullable field. Though it will always be returned (if it is set to
			be returned even if it were not nullable).
		</li>
		<li>
			A <code>?</code> after the "Property" name means that the property
			may not always be returned, but when it is, it will always the type
			indicated.
		</li>
		<li>
			Each property can have a number of superscript note indicators after
			it, these indicators correspond to a note(s) at the bottom of the
			table.
		</li>
	</ul>
