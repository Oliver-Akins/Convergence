	<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
	<p>
		The API supports authentication through two different methods, both of
		which are equivalent in their authorization capabilities.
	</p>
	<h3 id="cookie">Cookie Authentication</h3>
	<p>
		This authentication strategy is used for the website that sets a session
		cookie in the browser and authenticates further requests as the user.
		In order to receive a cookie for authentication a request must be made
		to one of the <a href="/docs/endpoints#logins"><code>POST /login/*</code> endpoints</a>.
		This is the only authentication strategy allowed for accounts that don't
		have a password associated with their account.
	</p>
	<h3 id="basic">BASIC Authentication</h3>
	<p>
		This authentication strategy is primarily for third party API interaction
		allowing systems to authenticate more easily than handling cookie. This
		strategy requires that you use the ID of the account as the username,
		and the password, which means that if the user doesn't have a password
		for their account that this authentication strategy cannot be used.
